# Open Source Feedback Database

This is an open database of bugs and feature suggestions for Dual Universe.

It is unofficial and to my knowledge NQ aren't watching it.

Basically I wanted a place to quickly list my feature suggestions and bugs, as I found the official issue reporting process a bit laborious.

I also potentially wanted a place where people could discuss suggestions.

In a cosmic coincidence, NQ released their [upvote website](https://upvote.dualuniverse.game) for game feature suggestions a couple of days after I started using this Github repo.

## Official Submissions

These issues are a place for me (and anyone else who wants to) to record and discuss things, but I still encourage you to submit them to the proper places.

I certainly intend to do so with my stuff. I will [submit bugs to the support site](https://support.dualthegame.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), and [submit suggestions to the upvote site](https://upvote.dualuniverse.game/suggestions/add).

If you have submitted something, post a comment on the relevant issue containing the URL for your submission, so that other people can tie them together.
